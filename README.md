# Flask Age Calculator App Documentation

## Overview
This is a simple Flask web application that calculates a person's age based on their birth year. The user enters their birth year in a form, and the app calculates and displays their age.

## Features
- Accepts a birth year input from the user.
- Calculates the user's age based on the current year.
- Displays the calculated age on the webpage.
- Uses Flask for backend processing.

## Requirements
To run this application, you need:
- Python (>=3.x)
- Flask (install using `pip install flask`)

## File Structure
```
/flask_age_calculator/
│── app.py  # Main Flask application
│── /templates/
│   ├── index.html  # HTML template for the app
```

## How to Run the App
1. Install Flask:
   ```sh
   pip install flask
   ```
2. Save `app.py` in a directory.
3. Create a `templates` folder and save `index.html` inside it.
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
5. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
6. Enter your birth year and click submit to see your calculated age.

## Usage Example
1. User enters `2000` in the input field.
2. The app displays: "Your age is: 24" (if the current year is 2024).

## Future Improvements
- Add error handling for invalid inputs.
- Enhance the UI using CSS or Bootstrap.
